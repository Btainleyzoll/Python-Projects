Welcome to my Vulnerability Scanner. In this project, there is a Vulnerability Port Scanner that identifies open ports on a given host, detects running services, and cross-references them against the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) to report known CVEs.

The scanner can run in live mode (scanning a target system in real time) or in test mode (using predefined services/versions to validate detection and vulnerability matching, to make sure everything is working as intended).

How it Works:
1. User input: User enters a IP/hostname and what ports they want to check(all, common, range, or list).
2. Port scan: Detects which ports, from the user specifications, are open using multithreaded socket connections.
3. Service Detection: Gets the banners to identify the running services and versions.
4. Vulnerability Matching: Cross references the detected services with the NVD dataset.
5. Report Generation: Creates the report that is saved and displayed in the /reports

Features of Scanner:
- Supports scanning of all 0-65535 ports, to common ports to custom ranges from the user.
- Uses multithreading (concurrent.futures) fro more efficient scanning.
- Uses the socket module to attempt to connect to ports and extract service banners.
- Detects the popular services like Apache or OpenSSH.
- Extracts the versions if possible.
- Loads NCD JSON data and parses the CPEs(Common Platform Enumeration).
- Matches the detected services/versions with the Dataset from NVD.
- Results are shown in teh console and written in a txt document that is timestamped.
- Reports include open ports, detected services, versions, and vulnerabilities(if any).

Skills Demonstrated
Python Standard Libraries:
- socket: for port scanning, TCP connections, and banner grabbing.
- threading and concurrent.futures: multithreading for faster scanning.
- os, sys, datetime: Handles files and user interactions and timestamping.
- json: Parsing the NVD JSON data.
- re: extracts service versions from banners
External Libraries:
- tqdm: makes a progress bar for the port scans
